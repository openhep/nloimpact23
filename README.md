This is the code for the analysis done for the paper

   * M. Čuić, G. Duplančić, K. Kumerički, and K. Passek-K.,  _NLO corrections to the deeply virtual meson production revisited: impact on the extraction of generalized parton distributions_, to be finished soon

Jupyter/Python notebooks ``nloimpact.ipynb`` and  ``LT_separation.ipynb`` show in detail how numerical results
and plots in the paper are obtained. They provide also some additional numerics and plots.
These files are commented and should be readable immediately here on
the github. If you want to run them yourself, you need the [Gepard](https://gepard.phy.hr) 
Python package.

If you find bugs, please, report them either through github "Issues" or directly to
authors via email (easily found at [arXiv](http://arXiv.org)).
